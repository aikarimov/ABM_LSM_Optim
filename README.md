# ABM_LSM_Optim
This repository contains codes for reconstructing dynamical systems using the least square method. 

## Overview

Suppose, the problem is to find a description of a continuous dynamical system in a form of an autonomous odrinary differential equation
$$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}),$$
and we have a number of sample points of the trajectiory $\mathbf{x}(t_i)$, but the mathematical description of the function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ is unknown. 

Suppose, every line of a function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ is a sum of monomials with coefficients, like

$$f_j(\mathbf{x}) = 2x + 3y^2 + 17yz \dots, $$

where $\mathbf{x} = (x,y,z, \dots) ^\top$ is a phase vector, any combination of its entries $x,y^2,yz$ is a monomial, and $2,3,17$ are coefficients. Then, we can use ABM_LSM_Optim to find $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ in such a form.

For example, we have a recorded three-dimensional trajectory $\mathbf{x} = (x,y,z)^\top$ as in the left pane below, shown blue.

We randomly select some sample points, shown green-yellow in the middle pane, and reconstruct sparse, readable equations of the system using a function `PolyRegression`, obtaining:

$$\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{x} = -10x + 10y \\
& \dot{y} = 28x - y - xz\\
& \dot{z} = -2.6667z - xy\\
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}$$

Then, we can solve this reconstructed system with a standard matlab solver like `ode45`, using a function `oderecon` as a required function. The obtained trajectory is shown yellow in the right pane.

## Installation
Download a zip file or via git, and then add the ABM_LSM_Optim directory to your search path:

```
## Algorithm

The code ABM_LSM_Optim uses two basic algorithms: the least square method (LSM) for evaluating unknown coefficient of equations and the approximate Buchberger-Moller (ABM) algorithm for excluding vanishing monomials
