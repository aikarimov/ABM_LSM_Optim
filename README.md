# ABM_LSM_Optim
This repository contains codes for reconstructing dynamical systems using the least square method. 

## Overview

Suppose, we find a description of a continuous dynamical system in a form of an autonomous odrinary differential equation
$$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}),$$
and a number of sample points of the trajectiory $\mathbf{x}(t_i)$ is known, but the mathematical description of a derivative function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ is not. For example, we have a recorded  three-dimensional trajectory $\mathbf{x = (x,y,z)^\top$ as in the left pane below, shown blue. 

![Fig1](https://github.com/aikarimov/ABM_LSM_Optim/blob/main/scheme.drawio.png)

We randomly select some sample points, shown gree-yellow in the middle pane, and reconstruct equations of the system using them, obtaining:

$$\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{\mathbf{x}} = -10x + 10y \\
& \dot{\mathbf{y}} = 28x - y - xz\\
& \dot{\mathbf{z}} = -2.6667z - xy\\
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}$$

## Algorithm

The code ABM_LSM_Optim uses two basic algorithms: the least square method (LSM) for evaluating unknown coefficient of equations and the approximate Buchberger-Moller (ABM) algorithm for excluding vanishing monomials
